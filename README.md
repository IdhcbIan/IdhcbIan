## About Me
Hello! I'm an Applied Math and Computer Science Student at ICMC USP, I am really passionate about working on hard problems and building the future. In university I took an interest in AI and computer science. Mainly, the use of smarter systems to push the frontier of human knowledge and achievements greatly interest me! I'm a deep believer in efficiency and simplicity, fast execution and iterative improvements will take us to the stars.
